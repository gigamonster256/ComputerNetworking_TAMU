Here are several enhancements made to the code, with explanations for each improvement:

### 1. **Error Handling for `atoi` (port conversion)**:
   The original code uses `atoi` to convert the port argument to an integer, which doesn’t handle errors well. If the input is invalid, `atoi` will return `0`, which is a valid value for a port. Using `strtol` instead provides better error handling.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   char *endptr;
   long port = strtol(argv[3], &endptr, 10);
   if (*endptr != '\0' || port <= 0 || port > 65535) {
       std::cerr << "Invalid port number: " << argv[3] << std::endl;
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:** 
   This ensures that the port number is properly validated and within the valid range for TCP/UDP ports (0-65535).

---

### 2. **Improved `client.readn` Error Handling**:
   The code reads data from the server using `client.readn` but does not properly handle cases where the server might close the connection unexpectedly or not send the complete message. Adding proper checks for the return value ensures robust error handling.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   ssize_t bytes_read = client.readn((void *)server_response.data(), sizeof(message_t::header_t));
   if (bytes_read <= 0) {
       std::cerr << "Failed to read from server or server disconnected" << std::endl;
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   This ensures that any disconnection or failure during reading from the server is handled gracefully instead of causing undefined behavior or program crashes.

---

### 3. **Error Handling for `writen`**:
   Writing data over the network may also fail (for example, if the connection is lost). We should ensure proper error handling for `client.writen`.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   if (client.writen((void *)join_msg.data(), join_msg.size()) <= 0) {
       std::cerr << "Failed to send JOIN message" << std::endl;
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   By checking the return value of `writen`, we ensure that if there is an error while sending data, it will be caught early, and the program can handle it properly instead of silently failing.

---

### 4. **Non-blocking I/O and Signal Handling**:
   Using `select` for managing input/output between the client and stdin is fine but lacks the flexibility of modern event-based systems. Switching to non-blocking sockets and using proper signal handling would improve this. However, in this context, handling signals (e.g., `SIGINT`) to gracefully shut down the client might be a simpler first step.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   signal(SIGINT, [](int /*signum*/) {
       std::cout << "\nShutting down client" << std::endl;
       exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
   });
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   This allows the client to shut down gracefully when interrupted (e.g., via Ctrl+C), instead of exiting abruptly. This improves the user experience during manual interruptions.

---

### 5. **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) Principle**:
   The repeated logic for reading a `message_t` from the server (two `client.readn` calls) should be refactored into a helper function to avoid duplicating code.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   bool read_message(tcp::Client &client, message_t &msg) {
       ssize_t header_size = client.readn((void *)msg.data(), sizeof(message_t::header_t));
       if (header_size <= 0) return false;

       ssize_t body_size = client.readn((void *)(msg.data() + sizeof(message_t::header_t)), msg.get_length());
       if (body_size <= 0) return false;

       return true;
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   This improves code readability and maintainability by encapsulating the message reading logic into a reusable function.

---

### 6. **Improved Idle Handling**:
   The current idle handling checks the time difference but can be made clearer and more flexible by encapsulating this into its own function.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   bool has_been_idle_for(const timespec &last_active_time, int seconds) {
       struct timespec now;
       clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &now);
       return (now.tv_sec - last_active_time.tv_sec) >= seconds;
   }

   if (has_been_idle_for(spec, 10)) {
       const message_t idle_msg = IDLE();
       client.writen((void *)idle_msg.data(), idle_msg.size());
       idle = true;
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   This separates concerns and makes the logic of checking idle time easier to read and modify. If you ever need to change the idle threshold or extend the time-checking logic, it’s easier to adjust in one place.

---

### 7. **Prompt Display Refinement**:
   Instead of toggling the prompt display using the `displayed_prompt` flag, it might be better to have a dedicated method that manages user prompt display.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   void display_prompt() {
       std::cout << "> " << std::flush;
   }

   // Call this function when needed
   display_prompt();
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   Separating the prompt display logic from the main loop improves code readability and makes it easier to customize the behavior in the future.

---

### 8. **Memory Alignment and Object Construction**:
   The message construction (like `JOIN()`, `SEND()`) may benefit from modern C++ features such as uniform initialization and better memory management practices. However, since the provided `message_t` object structure isn’t fully visible, this improvement suggestion is limited without further details. Consider using modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, RAII) where applicable.

---

### 9. **Exiting the Loop with Meaning**:
   Currently, when a blank message is entered, the program just `break`s from the loop. It would be more intuitive to print a message informing the user that they are exiting the session.

   **Improvement:**
   ```cpp
   if (message.empty()) {
       std::cout << "Exiting session..." << std::endl;
       break;
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   This provides better feedback to the user when they are exiting the session, making the program more user-friendly.

---

### 10. **Additional Code Style Suggestions**:
   - Use `std::string` instead of raw C-style strings where possible.
   - Consider organizing the code into functions/modules for cleaner separation of concerns.

By addressing these improvements, the code will be more robust, readable, and maintainable, with proper error handling and code separation.
